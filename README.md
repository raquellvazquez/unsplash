## Features

Streamy was developed using different technologies such as:

- :bulb: **Create React App**: create-react-app is an official React CLI that allows you to create applications as quickly as possible, and with zero configurations.

- :gear: **Axios**: Axios is a simple promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js. Axios provides a simple to use library in a small package with a very extensible interface.


- :dart: **Unsplash API** : The Unsplash API is a modern JSON API that surfaces all of the info you’ll need to build any experience for your users. It’s so simple to use that we even run unsplash.com on it!.
